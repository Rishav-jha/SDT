ES-6 Fundamentals


JavaScript let - The let statement allows you to declare a variable with block scope.

JavaScript const - The const statement allows you to declare a constant (a JavaScript variable with a constant value).
Constants are similar to let variables, except that the value cannot be changed.

JavaScript Arrow Functions - Arrow functions allows a short syntax for writing function expressions.
You don't need the function keyword, the return keyword, and the curly brackets.

JavaScript Classes - A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it, we use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method.Use the keyword class to create a class, and always add a constructor method.
The constructor method is called each time the class object is initialized.

Default parameter values - 
Array.find()
Array.findIndex()
Exponentiation (**) 


New Global Methods
ES6 also added 2 new global number methods:

isFinite()
isNaN()
